# team-profile-generator
  ## Description 
  This homework was to create a node app that allows user input to generate an HTML page from said input. Using inquirer to for the prompts and jest for the tests along with class constuctor methods this app I believe satisfies the criteria.

  The requirements for this homework are as follows:

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
  THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input 
  WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
  THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address 
  WHEN I click on the GitHub username
  THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
  WHEN I start the application
  THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
  WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
  THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
  WHEN I select the engineer option
  THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
  WHEN I select the intern option
  THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
  WHEN I decide to finish building my team
  THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
